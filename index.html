                    <h1>Blomendal</h1>
                    <p>One of the mightiest castles in the Hanseatic city of Bremen was built in the twelfth century. The castle was considered impregnable and was almost as well equipped as the king's castle. It was built by Sir Christians after he was promoted from the rank of knight to the rank of count by the king of the kingdom of Bremen for his heroic deeds in the war against the Lower Saxony. Many years passed, during which the descendants of Sir Christians inherited the rank of Count van Blomendal. In 1395 Sir Leonhart count van Blomendal was born. He received training in warfare and etiquette at the king's brother's court. 
                        After 16 years, Leonhart returned to Bloemendal and took over the reigns.
                        For ten years he led his subordinates with patience and warmth and made Blomendal a place of trust. This brought him great recognition and wealth.

                    <h1>The Duke of Blomendal</h1>
                    <p>After ten years, the King asked Leonhart for help. The point is that a second alliance came together within the Kingdom of Bremen to overthrow the king. As a close confidant of the king, you set out to defend the king's honor and smash the supposedly secret alliance.
                        Leonhart packed his things, the sword that once belonged to Sir Christians was particularly important. This was adorned with blue sapphires and red rubies on the hand guard. the handle also contains a valuable diamond. These colors also adorn the coat of arms of the van Blomendals. 
                        As Leonhart set out, he was overcome by an uneasy feeling. The alliance seemed to continue to grow. He already had an inkling who might be behind the intrigue, he just had to prove it. His suspicion related to the Earl of Vegesac, Leohart's arch-enemy, who had already submitted one or the other difficult fight to him in tournaments.

                        The black decorations and ornaments stand for power which must never be exploited.
                        The color red stands for the courage that all members of the van Blomendal's carry within them.
                        Every member of the van Blomedals family has stood for the virtues of this coat of arms since birth.
                        
                        This code of conduct meant that royalty valued their standing, and that subjects enjoyed going to war and partying with the earl.

                    <h1>The Earl of Vegesac</h1>
                    <p>The Earl of Vegesac was a bad guy. His first name was Daimos, this was a name that brought evil from the beginning.
                        
                        The Earl's colors were green and white. Although he claimed that green stands for peace, secretly everyone knew that the color green stood for his favorite weapon, poison.

                        The Earl was once the son of the best friend of the actual ruler of Vegesac. He persuaded his father to arrange the marriage between him and the ruler's daughter. On the evening of the wedding, Diamos was frightened and used poison to silence his father-in-law forever. He was so greedy for power that he wanted to increase the empire of Vegesac through more and more intrigues. To do this, he dribbled honey into the king's ear. But he hadn't counted on Leonhart Blomendal, who always gave the king the most precise advice and made life difficult for him.
                        
                        When he realized that his words were not heard by the king, he formed an alliance with the earls of Newland and Vähr.
                        
                        These gathered the troops to overthrow the king.

                    <h1>The great Fight</h1>
                    <p>On July 20, 1421, the fight for the crown broke out.

                        The loyal vassals that Leonhart gathered around him were Count von Farg his cousin. The great Earl of Aumd who had to fight against the Earl of Vegesac because Aumd was right next to Vegesac and the Earl was trying to expand his empire.
                        However, the Count of Aumd managed to put Daimos to flight.
                        
                        Thus the Count of Aumd had become familiar with the formation of the individual garrisons and led them all into battle.
                        
                        Right at the beginning of the shock when the poor met, some of Farg's soldiers ran over to Daimos' side, he had lured them with a lot of gold and their own land as a reward.
                        In this raid they succeeded in overthrowing the great Earl of Aumd.
                        Now Leonhart took over the leadership and he managed to fight his way through the opposing ranks and was now face to face with Aimos.
                        
                        A heart-rending battle ensued between the two. Daimos had poisoned his sword before the battle and managed to weaken Leonhart.
                        
                        However, he managed to keep Daimos busy until his cousin the Count of Farg came to his aid and took Daimos prisoner.
                        
                        Now the skirmishes of the soldiers ended.
                        Leonhart passed out and was taken to the king's castle by his subjects, where he received medical care.

                        The king sentenced Daimos to death by quartering.
                        As a thank you from the king, Leonhart received a letter from the king sealed with the royal seal.
                        In this letter he found the deed for the land of Daimos whoever carried this deed could claim the land for himself.
                        Leonhart decided to pass the document on to the surviving sons of the Count of Aumd. They built a port in Vegesac and thus ensured that the north of Bremen received a successful trading market. The end.

                This project was created based on the idea of ​​a children's story using only HTML and CSS.
